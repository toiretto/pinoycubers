## Installation Instructions

### (Using Vagrant)

Instructions for **Windows**. Sorry, I am a .NET dev as well. Can't get away with windows.

1. Install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) and setup system path.

		e.g. C:\cygwin64\bin
	
	Don't forget to choose the following packages :
	
	- **chere**: Cygwin Prompt Here context menus
	- **make**: The GNU version of 'make' utility
	- **openssh**: The OpenSSH server and client programs


2. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. Clone repository
 
		git clone https://bitbucket.org/geocine/pinoycubers.git

4. Right click the `pinoycubers` folder and click `Bash Prompt Here`
5. While on the cygwin terminal. Type this:

		vagrant up

6. Add pinoycubers.dev to host file. *(Use the exact IP address)*
		
		10.0.0.100 pinoycubers.dev

#### Configuring Laravel

1. Enter *Vagrant's* ssh

		vagrant ssh	

2. Migrate the database

		php artisan migrate
 
#### Connecting to MySQL on *Vagrant*
	
	host 	- 127.0.0.1
	username - root
	password - root
	port	 - 3308


## Contribution Guidelines

**Live Site** : http://pinoycubers.org/

 - Send me a message on Facebook if you want to help me with the app, I would add you as tester on Facebook.
 - When planning a pull-request to add new functionality, it may be wise to [submit a proposal](https://github.com/geocine/pinoycubers/issues/new) to ensure compatibility with the project's goals.
 - I suggest using *Vagrant* for development environment configuration

### Tool Suggestion

1. You may use [Crunchapp](http:http://crunchapp.net/) or [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) for compiling less files. We only need to compile `bootstrap.less` and `site.less`
2. I prefer [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for an IDE. [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) for an editor.

### Commit Message Rules

1. **Why is this change necessary?**

	This question tells what to expect in the commit, to easily identify and point out unrelated changes.

2. **How does it address the issue?**

	Describe, at a high level, what was done to affect change. Here are some good examples:
		Introduce a red/black tree to increase search speed 
		Remove <X>, which was causing <specific description of issue introduced by X>
	If your change is obvious, you may be able to omit addressing this question.

3. The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which **uses the imperative, present tense** "change", not "changed" or "changes". See example in #2
